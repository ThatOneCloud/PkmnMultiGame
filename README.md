PkmnMultiGame
=============
This is a project for a game I'm working on in my spare time.  The idea is to create a Pokemon MMO (as if it'll ever be finished.)  To start, the objective is to create a foundational client and server that can ideally be used to build other games. So for now, there is nothing Pokemon specific - it is just a generic game server/client.
