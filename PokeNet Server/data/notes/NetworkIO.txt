PokeNet Network IO notes

NettyServer / NettyClient are responsible for starting up the 
communication channels. From there, each Player has a PacketSender 
which can be used to send a packet.

Walkthrough sending a Packet:
	1. Request made to PacketSender (to send a packet)
	2. Packet is created by PacketFactory
	3. Packet is written to the channel
		3.1. Packet is encoded through PacketEncoder
		3.2. Packet passes through LengthPrepender
	4. Packet is received
	5. Packet is put through channel pipeline
		5.1. Packet is divided by LengthFieldDecoder
		5.2. PacketDecoder will have a new Packet object made
		5.3. PacketHandler will have the Packet object handled

Be aware of:
	-PacketConstants and PacketManager must be updated when a Packet is added
	-Writes happen in order, same for receiving. Handling is not guaranteed.
	-CompositePacket can be used to assure handling order
