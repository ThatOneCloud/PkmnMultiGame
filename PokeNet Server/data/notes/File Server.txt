PokeNet File Server notes

The File Server takes care of file system stuff.  The idea is that other 
parts of the server don't really need to know about the file system. 
They can request access to a file.  They can then manipulate that file 
themselves or have a listener to do it for them.

Steps the system takes:
1. Request is created
2. Request is submitted to server
3. Request gets its turn to be handled
	3.1 Request has its handle(...) method called
	3.2 That method then calls the RequestHandler its been given
4. RequestHandler delegates to a more specific handler
   (breaking down the problem)
5. Specific handler takes care of nitty gritty details
6. Request is notified that it's ready

To create a request, you need a FileAddress. Again, this exists 
to decouple the file system from the rest of the server modules. 
FileAddressBuilder is there to help.

In a nutshell, you create and submit a request. 
You can then wait for the request to be ready and carry on from 
where you submitted it, or you can specify a listener to take action 
on the file when it's ready.  So blocking and non-blocking behavior 
is supported easy-peasy.
