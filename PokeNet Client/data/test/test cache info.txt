Cache Contents:

Number of files in the cache (5)
So 0x00 00 00 05

Then:
5 integers (4 bytes each)... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
0x00 00 00 01
0x00 00 00 02
etc


Cache Table Contents:
5 rows, 8 bytes each (for position of each test integer)
0x00 00 00 00 00 00 00 04
0x00 00 00 00 00 00 00 08
0x00 00 00 00 00 00 00 0C
0x00 00 00 00 00 00 00 10
0x00 00 00 00 00 00 00 14
